# Record a PR-ready task: store one validated canonical pr=<url>, the forge's
# exact pr_head=<sha> when available, and the pull request's destination
# branch as pr_dest=<name> when known, then atomically arm a static merge
# poll. The watcher check source is byte-for-byte bin/fm-pr-poll.sh; task and
# PR data live only in a private sidecar and are never interpolated into
# shell source. A GitHub pull request URL, a GitLab merge request URL
# (including on a self-hosted instance), and a Bitbucket Cloud pull request
# URL are all accepted; bin/fm-pr-lib.sh owns the exact URL grammars.
#
# pr_dest is what lets bin/fm-teardown.sh's and bin/fm-pr-poll.sh's git-based
# landed-work test compare against the PULL REQUEST'S destination instead of
# always assuming the repository's default branch - most pull requests target
# the default branch, but one that does not would otherwise be judged against
# the wrong branch forever. It is read from the optional third argument when
# the caller already knows it, else auto-derived from the forge (GitHub's gh
# CLI exposes baseRefName as a selectable field); GitLab records none, for the
# same reason it records no pr_head (below); Bitbucket has no CLI at all, so a
# Bitbucket task needs the third argument to get a destination narrower than
# the default branch. Either source is revalidated with
# `git check-ref-format --branch` before being recorded, and a missing
# destination is not an error: every consumer defaults to the default branch
# when none is recorded, matching prior behavior. The one exception is a
# re-arm of the exact same pr= URL with no destination supplied this call
# (for example bin/fm-pr-merge.sh's internal re-arm before merging): that
# keeps the previously recorded pr_dest instead of wiping it, since nothing
# about the pull request's destination changed. A re-arm for a different URL
# still gets no carried-over destination.
# Usage: fm-pr-check.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [dest-branch]
